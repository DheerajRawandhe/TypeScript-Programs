# TypeScript-Programs
I learned some concepts in TypeScript, including data types like string, number, boolean, array. I also explored functions with type annotations, return types.

# Typescript :- TypeScript is a strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript. It adds static typing, interfaces, and modern JavaScript features to make development more efficient and error-free. Microsoft developed TypeScript, and it is widely used for large-scale applications.

- Static Typing: Helps catch errors during development instead of runtime.
- Better Code Readability: Improves maintainability with well-defined types.
